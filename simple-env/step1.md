## Task

Clone https://github.com/tetratelabs/istio-cloud-map to our katacoda systems

`git clone https://github.com/tetratelabs/istio-cloud-map tet-istio-cloud-map-operator` {{execute}}

Hmm I wonder why that's not working 

<pre>`echo "Run in Terminal"`{{execute}}</pre>

That doesn't @#!@# work either.
