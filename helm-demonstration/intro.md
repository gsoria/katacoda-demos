In this self paced tutorial we will walk through the steps to become familiar with the basic functions of Helm.

## Let's get started

We will:

1. Install Helm 
2. Download an example Helm Chart
3. Package our own Helm Chart
4. Save it locally
5. Install our local, custom, Helm chart
6. Take a look at our installation
7. Manually upgrade the release information in Chart.yaml. Do this three times.
8. Upgrade, then rollback version changes. 
9. Install a second Helm chart alongside the first installation.
10. Delete and clean up our Helm installations when we're done.
