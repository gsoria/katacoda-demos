In this self paced tutorial we will walk through the steps to become familiar with the Istio Cloud Map operator.

## Let's get started

First, we will install Envoy and set it up as a basic front proxy. These steps are available thanks to the Envoy team:

We have provided a short demo of Envoy working as a basic front proxy in this demonstration.

Next, we will set up Istio and install CRDs and verify the installation.

Then we will finish by installing the Istio Cloud Map operator.
